### What is this repository for? ###

As this repository is just a POC, there is not much to find here.
Please come back later for more content and gameplay.

### How do I get set up? ###

On the branch master, there is a version of the project where the server uses XML as a database.
There are two clients: WPF and Console.

On branch dev-mysql_db the server is switched to use MySQL instead of XML.
